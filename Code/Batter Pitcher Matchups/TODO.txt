1. Parse the events .csv files into one dataframe
2. Clean up the duplicates in the pitcher stats (using keep='first' in Pandas drop_duplicates()
3. Turn the batter and pitcher stats into lookup tables (store these to read them back in more quickly)
4. Take out only the data that I need from the events file (store this to read it back in more quickly)
5. Figure out the playerids
6. Run through and calculate the expected outcome for each matchup and combine the needed information into one dataframe
